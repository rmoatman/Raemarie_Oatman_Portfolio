## Description
~~~
The initial intent of this project was to both gain experience developing a website and also to begin the process of creating a portfolio.

The portfolio highlights my strongest work and the thought processes behind it.  The acceptance criteria included having a photo, navigation links, project cards with headers, an about me section, and a contact me section.

I have recently updated the project cards to highlight some of my best work thus far.  Several project cards are still under construction that represent future projects.  This section will be updated as I continue to learn more.

The core skills demonstrated in this project include flexbox, media queries, and CSS variables.  In this updated version, I also used Foundations for Sites.  Additional acceptance criteria includes: "When the portfolio is loaded, the navigation links should work correctly, the initial project should be represented by a larger size image, and the layout should adopt to various sizes and viewports".
